PANDAS Homework Assignment | Due 7/8/2020 | Data Analytics 

This Jupyter Notebook file uses PANDAS to look at two data sets for PyCity Schools and displays it in tables. Screenshots of the completed tables are in the Screenshots folder. Using the tables, the following analysis can be made:

Analysis

Using the tables created above, several trends are evident for PyCity Schools:
(1) Differences in math scores are significantly more exaggerated than reading scores across the different schools. Whether the schools are evaluated by spending, size, and type, math education is more sensitive than reading.
(2) Students have higher scores in both subjects in smaller, better-funded schools.
(3) When schools are sorted by type (District and Charter), the scores for charter schools are higher. Charter schools in this data set to be smaller than the district schools, and it has already been noted that smaller sizes appear to lead to higher scores. At the same time, however, the bottom five performing schools--which are all district schools--outspent the top five performing schools--all charter.
